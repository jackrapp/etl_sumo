# etl_sumo

We used data from data.world:
- https://data.world/cervus/sumo-results
- https://data.world/cervus/sumo-banzuke

Our goal was to explain better the data contained in the sumo-results and sumo-banzuke files, breaking the data into smaller description tables.

- Rank - Nate
- Heya - Max
- Shusshin - Maria
- Kimarate - Jackie
- Results - Peter

Nate, Max and Jackie webscraped wikipedia to add descriptions/context to their tables.
Maria created a visualization of each Shusshin (hometown) across Japan.
Peter pulled the win/loss ratios and created predictions based on the previous 15 matches.

Saved files were put into sqlite and csv format for future practical application.
