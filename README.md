# etl_sumo

We used data from data.world:
https://data.world/cervus/sumo-results
https://data.world/cervus/sumo-banzuke

Our goal was to explain better the data contained in the sumo-results and sumo-banzuke files, breaking the data into smaller description tables.

Rank - Nate </n>
Heya - Max /n
Shusshin - Maria /n
Kimarate - Jackie /n
Results - Peter /n

Nate, Max and Jackie webscraped wikipedia to add descriptions/context to their tables. /n
Maria created a visualization of each Shusshin (hometown) across Japan. /n
Peter pulled the win/loss ratios and created predictions based on the previous 15 matches. /n

Saved files were put into sqlite and csv format for future practical application.
